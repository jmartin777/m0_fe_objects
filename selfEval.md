# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

1.**I struggled with just implementing the proper syntax in laying out Objects. After repeating the process and getting the hang of it, implementing objects withing an array started to make sense and how to access these key-value pairs in code and the terminal.


- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

2.**Its been my saving grace being able to take good notes and documentation. I personally like taking screen shots of notes and examples to always have for sourcing and checking back on. I find myself taking successful notes when I  re-cap on previous notes again and again, layering more onto them by writing them down and having visual aids to back them up.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

3.**When I google a problem , Im learning to keep strict on what sources Im pulling from and if i can actually decipher what source im pulling from. I feel there so many levels of code and so many paths people have come from when it comes to coding. Im finding what archives of code I can pull from and whats not ideal.I dont find it to be helpful when i just throw myself into coding early on . I perosnall like to follow the steps of pseudocode to a point to reallt help me clarify a problem.
